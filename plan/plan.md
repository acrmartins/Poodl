# Plan for the article


* On the need of having computational models of public opinion:
  * Feedback between public and politicians --> explore the many sides of this;
* Soo how do we connect the background knowledge we have in political science with the literature in opinion dynamics?
  * First we think about preferences and beliefs
  * Then we look for models that are more or less consistent with what we know
  * this leads us to quasi-bayesian models
* The next step is to propose the model; the methodology of analysis and the analysis.
