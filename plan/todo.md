# Things to do

 *  ___Right now i gotta fix the constructors (for the belief, agent, and population)__
 * This will simplify some fns and lead to more idiomatic and type stable code
 * For an example of how to write constructors look at : https://github.com/JuliaGraphs/LightGraphs.jl/blob/c01aeda9f51c1f71aa24114302807437443f376c/src/SimpleGraphs/simpledigraph.jl#L3-L7 and https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/constructors/
