# Things to do

- Right now i gotta fix 03-analysisHelpers; rewrite some of the sim-analysis
  scripts and then test the plots; while running the tests i should add the
  modification andre asked for; i'll probably finish this modification before
  the simulations finishs running, so i gotta start to write the paper with
  andre too... after adding this code i must also create another repository for
  the physics paper code.
  
 - test calculate_pstar; write about the model !!!!! 
 
 - then gotta implement functions that use this new pstar
 
 - then run the tests
